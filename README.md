# Sonic Triple Trouble 16bit Remake Decompilation
A decompilation of Sonic Triple Trouble 16bit Remake (Unfinished)

GameMaker Version is ```2022.0.0.19```
> You probably could get away with using the 2022 LTS

### THIS IS UNFINISHED AND WILL STAY UNFINISHED
Why, because I can't code for shit

The only things that are missing are scripts and objects, everything else is included
> but the basic code structure is still intact, you just need to code everything together

### Downloads
will be in Releases

I can't bother with git push rn

## Made by QuantumV's Decompiler
